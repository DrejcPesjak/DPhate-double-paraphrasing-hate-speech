 - A Counter Narrative (CN) is a non-negative response to a Hate Speech (HS), target-ing and contradicting extreme statements with fact-bound  arguments  or  alternative  viewpoints. Such strat-egy seeks to de-escalate the conversation, disen-gage from hateful sentiment and encourage mu-tual understanding through exchange of opinions.

studies before have tried counter-narratives, which tell the user why his/her comment is inadaquit, 
kinda implying / under the assumption that a computer could not edit the comment properly, only a human could

at times when people get offended even faster, it is crusial to not just detect a hateful comment when it gets out, but to prevent them all together
